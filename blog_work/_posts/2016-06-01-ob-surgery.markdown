## Sugery scene  
*Shoulder Arthroscopy Surgery - 
[Rotator cuff Injury]({{site.url}}/blog_work/work-doc/dis_base_bone_rotator_cuff_injury.pdf)*  
After arriving at PWH, we were led to Changing room to change clothes. Then we came to operation room (OR) 3-02 and seeing doctors preparing the operation.

Shown in the pictures above are the procedure of fixing patient's arm, adjusting the light source to focus on the operation site, separately. Meawhile, the anesthetist and the assisatnt surgeon finished their preparations.

During the fixation of patient's arm, an pneumatic instrument was introduced to us - 'The Spider' (shown in the left). This instrument has 3 joints to fulfill the requirements of 3 Degree of Freedom (DoF). To control the holder's position, a foot pedal functioning as the interface/switch was put under the operating table for considering the safty and convenience. Once the pedal is pressed by surgeon, the Spider can be positioned freely and easily, although manually. Otherwise it fixes on certain position. According to the observation, surgery on bones highly requires the stabilization, more than any other requirements. This equipment is highly necessary and has its significane during the shoulder arthroscopy surgery.

Before operation initiates, and also during the operation, Docotrs and us were discussing about the improvment of the surgical instruments from both medical and engineering perspectives.

Operation started with establishing the channel and the insertion of arthroscopy.  Following step is to clean the surroundings to make sure that doctors have a clear view. After cleaning, it is time to screw the shoulder tension.

**Instruments**  
The tools, screws adopted during the operation are specifically designed with certain bio-compatible materials with special structure, shown in the pictures.  

It was a really nice experience to join the real surgery scene. It helps me to understand that, the design the research, and the development of the innovative medical device and robots matter to the patients, but also for the surgeons. Thinking from the persepective of surgeons help to guide my research interests in the following Ph.D. study.
