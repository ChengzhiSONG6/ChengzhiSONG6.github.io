### News
During the past half year of my Ph.D. study, I was working with Prof. [Peter Kazanzides](http://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/people/peter-kazanzides/){:target="_blank"} and Dr. [Long Qian](http://longqian.me/){:target="_blank"} as a visiting student at [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"} in the Sensing, Manipulation, and Real-Time Systems [(SMARTS)](https://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"} lab, which is a member of the Laboratory for Computational Sensing + Robotics [(LCSR)](http://lcsr.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. The video illustrating our project can be found in my YouTube Channel: [Chengzhi Song](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8cGoer178dqIYzl2TPtYQA){:target="_blank"}, link also available by clicking on the YouTube icon on left sidebar.

### Interests
My research interests are Robot-Assited Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS), mechanical design of the flexible manipulator, vision-based surgical instrument tracking and control, and developments of robotic surgical components and systems, with emphasis on both scientific and engineering aspects.

I am also a big fan of sports, like american footbal, basketball, table-tennis and hiking, etc.
I'd like to share my life and some technical experience through posting these blogs.
