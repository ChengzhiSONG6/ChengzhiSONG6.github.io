I was a Research Assistant Professor in [Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/){:target="_blank"} (MAE) and [CUHK T Stone Robotics Institute](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ri){:target="_blank"}, [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk){:target="_blank"} (CUHK).

Supported by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html){:target="_blank"}, I received my Ph.D. degree in the MAE department at CUHK, advised by [Prof. Yun-hui Liu](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/people/list.php?name=yhliu){:target="_blank"} in July 2017, and then I served as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the MAE department at CUHK for half a year.
During the last two years of my Ph.D. study, I was working with [Prof. Peter Kazanzides](http://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/people/peter-kazanzides/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Russell H. Taylor](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht/){:target="_blank"} as a visiting student at [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"} in the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing + Robotics](http://lcsr.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
Prior to my Ph.D studies, I received B.E. degree at [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, China.

My research interests are vision-based soft object manipulation, vision-based surgical tool tracking and control, and developments of robotic surgical components and systems, with emphasis on both scientific and engineering aspects.
