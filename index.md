I'm from Urumqi, XinJiang, China and currently working with Prof. [Philip, Waiyan Chiu](https://www.med.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/professor-chiu-wai-yan-philip){:target="_blank"} and Prof. Zheng Li on my final year as a Ph.D. candidate in the Dept. of [Surgery](http://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk){:target="_blank"}, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, [CUHK](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk){:target="_blank"}. For those who are interested, you can further look into my formal

{% else %}[CV](/documents/CV_eng.pdf){:target="_blank"}
{% endif %} for your information.

I'd like to share my life and some technical experience through posting [blogs](../blog/){:target="_blank"}.

### News
During the past half year of my Ph.D. study, I was working with Prof. [Peter Kazanzides](http://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/people/peter-kazanzides/){:target="_blank"} and Dr. [Long Qian](http://longqian.me/){:target="_blank"} as a visiting student at [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"} in the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing + Robotics](http://lcsr.jhu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. The video illustrating our project can be found in my Youtube Channel: [Chengzhi Song](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8cGoer178dqIYzl2TPtYQA){:target="_blank"}, link also available by clicking on the Youtube icon on left sidebar.

### Interests
My research interests are vision-based soft object manipulation, vision-based surgical tool tracking and control, and developments of robotic surgical components and systems, with emphasis on both scientific and engineering aspects.
